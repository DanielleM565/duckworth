Duckworth is a Semi-automated platform that optimizes usage and cost savings based on historical consumption and weather forcasting 

We focused on a specific solution to the Duck Problem

!(https://goo.gl/images/vBJXMA)

The duck curve is a problem to consumer and grid operatorator becasue as the solar industry continues to grow we will start to see large surge or a spike in power being pulled from the grid after the sunsets. This can be costly for Time of Use customers as well as an unecessary stress to the gride having to ramp-up so quickly. 

Using tools such at Sunrun's power usage data we were able to analyze anomized customer energy usage for residnets that have solar and battery. As well as Darksky api to look at weather forcasting and Highchart.js to visualize the data. On the back end we used mySQL, python, docker and Panda to sort, index and analyse the data.   

We build a prototpye customer portal for sunrun user's to look at the usage and see how much they are saving.

Don't forget with our portal customers you can gain duckbucks to use trade or mine. Just another way to enage customers by making saving energy fun.
